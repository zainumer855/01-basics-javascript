Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.
GOOD LUCK �

// const markWeight = 78;
// const markHeight = 1.69;
// const johnWeight = 92;
// const johnHeight = 1.95;

const markWeight = 95;
const markHeight = 1.88;
const johnWeight = 85;
const johnHeight = 1.76;

const markBMI = markWeight / markHeight**2; 
const johnBMI = johnWeight / johnHeight**2;
const markHigherBMI = markBMI < johnBMI;
console.log(markBMI, johnBMI, markHigherBMI);
