/*
LECTURE: Values and Variables
1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)

2. Log their values to the console 


const country = 'Pakistan';
const continent = 'Asia';
const population = '245,209,815';
console.log(country, continent, population);

*/

const country = 'Pakistan';
const population = '245,209,815';

/*
LECTURE: Data Types
1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable 'language', but don't assign it any value yet

2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language' to the console 


const isIsland = 'Astola';
const isTrue = true;
let language;
console.log(typeof isIsland, typeof population, typeof country, typeof language, typeof isTrue);

*/

/*
LECTURE: let, const and var
1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)

2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.

3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens


let language;
language = 'Urdu';

const language2;
language2 = 'Urdu';
console.log(language, language2)

// SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
